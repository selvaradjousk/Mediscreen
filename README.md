 ### Project Domain goals:
- Provide a web app interface to users (**Health centers & Private clinics**) those who are interested in specialized information pertaining to _detection of potential risk factors_ associated _to diseases_ like diabetes.
- Provides reliable and up-to-date real-time information on the -Patients vulnerability_ to risk to diseases based on their individual _medical track records_ using a _predictive analysis_ approach with atmost accuracy.

 It is available as a web interface both on _PC & mobile platforms_ for _Abernathy clinic_ users & will be made extended to all users of different Health centers and private clinics customized to their potential goals.

 ### Key features
- Helps _maintain accurate information record_ on the Patients;
- Provides _enhanced Medical record management & maintenance_ capabilities with _better UX_ (User experience) on using the web app user nterface.
- Provides reliable and up-to-date real-time information through _Assessment Reports_ on their potential vulnerability to potential diseases based on the risk factors information persist on their medical record information.

To meet the  predictable possiblility on the anticipated explosive growth potential among the  user's client base in the health sector, the recent & modern cross-cutting edge technological integration in the architecture design has been implemented in this project to optimize performance for future high volume user demands.


## Technological Spec & Run Prerequisites

- Java 11 JDK
- Gradle 7.3
- Docker (Scalability)
- Discovery services (High availability)

## Architectural Spec:

Mediscreen application is composed of primarily 3 microservices:

- **Microservice: Patient**
- **Microservice: Notes**
- **Microservice: Assessment**
- + more complementary Microservices to enhance scalability & high availaibility features





## Application Run configuration

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/gradle-%23ED8B00.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=gradle&logoColor=white"/> <br/>
```
gradle bootRun or ./gradle bootRun
```
```
gradle bootWar or ./gradle bootWar or ./gradle bootJar
```

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/docker%20-%230db7ed.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white"/> <br/>

### Building Docker images

Use the **Dockerfile** on the package roots containing individual 4 services to build docker images

SYNTAX:
```
docker build . -f Dockerfile -t imageNameToBeCreated
```

### Running a Docker image

Use the  **DockerImage** created above & run a Docker image using the command below

SYNTAX:
```
docker run -d -p HostPort:InternalAppPort --name dockerContainerNameToBeCreated -d DockerImageName
```

### Docker Compose

In case, if want to use an automated multi-container workflow with docker-compose, follow details below:

To deploy all Mediscreen microservices in a single go, use the **docker-compose.yml** on the package root containing all services that will orchestrate multiple containers wherein it will make it to work together based on the defined configuration in it. (Feel free to change the configuration settings for you required workflow)

SYNTAX:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Testing

Gradle, Junit (Unit & Integration Tests). <br/>

SYNTAX:
```
gradlew test or ./gradlew test or gradlew clean test
```
